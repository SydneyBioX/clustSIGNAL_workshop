Description: This workshop serves as a tutorial for using clustSIGNAL
    (clustering of Spatially Informed Gene expression with Neighbourhood 
    Adapted Learning) - a method for adaptively smoothing and clustering 
    gene expression data obtained from molecule-resolved spatial transcriptomics 
    technologies.
